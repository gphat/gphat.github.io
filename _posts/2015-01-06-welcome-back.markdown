I write a lot at work. Most of my writing is in little status updates I mail about concerning a production change, a notable deploy or a (dreaded) outage. It's fun and people seem to like it. I think it will be nice to have an outlet for some of that material that is most general purpose and less work.

I'd like to tell you about some things. I'd also like to be known for a thing or two. Specifically things I've worked hard to learn about. Sometimes I will want to share things that I'm *learning* about but that I don't know yet. It'll be fun.
