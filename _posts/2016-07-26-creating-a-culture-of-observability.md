For a change of pace, I'd like to share a video of me talking, rather than writing something for you!

Recently I was lucky enough to be selected to speak at [Monitorama](http://www.monitorama.com) 2016 in June and I'm proud to post the video here for anyone interested in the work.

The gist is pretty simple: When I joined Stripe I quickly found a niche in working on Observability. You may be wondering what *observability* even is! Well,
in [control theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory), [observability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observability) is a measure for how well internal states of a system can be inferred by knowledge of its external outputs.

In other words, if our sensors — think about metrics, logs and traces — are good, then we can learn about how effectively our systems are working!

My job at Stripe is to make this *fucking awesome*. This talk is all about how my teammates and I approach the problem, what success and failures we've had and
how you can learn from that!

I hope you enjoy it. Be sure and reach out if you have questions or thoughts!
