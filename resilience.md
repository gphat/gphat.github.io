Through a career spanning over twenty years at ISPs, eCommerce shops, and technology giants like Twitter and Stripe I have learned that [complex systems will inevitably fail](https://how.complexsystems.fail). To repair and expand these systems, we need humans! The goal is to create [adaptive capacity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_capacity), to be resilient.

# Professional Work

After joining Twitter in 2012 as one of the first Site Reliability Engineers (SRE) I leaned into [observability](http://onemogin.com/observability/). While I still consider this work important, I came to the conclusion that **charts don't solve problems, people do.** This led me to invest more in learning about resilience engineering and adaptive capacity.

In 2019 I joined [SignalFx](https://www.signalfx.com), later [acquired by Splunk](https://www.signalfx.com/blog/signalfx-signs-definitive-agreement-to-be-acquired-by-splunk/) and researched resilience engineering and it's precursors to inform the design of products, organizations, and tooling. In 2021 I joined [Jeli](https://www.jeli.io) to work on [incident analysis](https://www.jeli.io/howie-the-post-incident-guide/) so that organizations can more easily learn from their work.

At RubyConf 2021 I spoke about finding inspiration for resilience in other industries and settings.

# Podcasts

* In November of 2021 I [spoke with Software Misadventures about failure and success in software engineering](https://softwaremisadventures.com/podcast/2021/11/cory-watson/).

# Publications

* [Technical Reviewer ](https://increment.com/reliability/letter-from-the-editor/)for [Increment: Issue 16, February 2021; Reliability](https://increment.com/reliability/) and [Increment: Issue 17, May 2021; Containers](https://increment.com/containers/letter-from-the-editor/).

# Future

Having spent most of my career on call I believe that organizations can greatly improve the happiness and effectiveness of employees and customers by investing in resilience!
