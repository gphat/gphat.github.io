Through a career spanning over twenty years at ISPs, eCommerce shops, and technology giants like Twitter and Stripe I have learned that [complex systems will inevitably fail](https://how.complexsystems.fail). To repair and expand these systems, we need humans! The goal is to create [adaptive capacity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_capacity), to be resilient.

# Professional Work

After joining Twitter in 2012 as one of the first Site Reliability Engineers (SRE) I leaned into [observability](http://onemogin.com/observability/). While I still consider this work important, I came to the conclusion that **charts don't solve problems, people do.** This led me to invest more in learning about resilience engineering and adaptive capacity.

In 2019 I joined [SignalFx](https://www.signalfx.com), later [acquired by Splunk](https://www.signalfx.com/blog/signalfx-signs-definitive-agreement-to-be-acquired-by-splunk/) and researched resilience engineering and it's precursors to inform the design of products, organizations, and tooling.
