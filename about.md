Hi! I'm Cory Watson.

I do computer things. I've been doing them for a while and I mostly grew up on the Internet doing them. I do lots of [Open Source things](http://github.com/gphat). I've worked at some cool places like [Magazines.com](http://www.magazines.com), [Infinity Interactive](http://www.iinteractive.com), [Twitter](http://twitter.com) and [Keen IO](http://keen.io). I'm proud of my work at all of these places. I've made friends and, more than anything, I've learned a lot.

<em>One Mo' Gin</em> a southern colloquial conflation of the terms "One More Time" and "Again". I used to think there was some emotional and or psychological reason why I loved this phrase so much, but nowadays I think I mostly just like the sound of it.
