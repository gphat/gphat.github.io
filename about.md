Hi! I'm Cory Watson.

I do computer things. I've been doing them for a while and mostly grew up on the Internet doing them. I do lots of [Open Source things](http://github.com/gphat). I've worked at some cool places like [Magazines.com](http://www.magazines.com), [Infinity Interactive](http://www.iinteractive.com), [Twitter](http://twitter.com), [Keen IO](http://keen.io), [Stripe](http://stripe.com),  [SignalFx](https://www.signalfx.com), [Splunk](https://www.splunk.com), [Jeli](https://jeli.io), and [Oilcan](https://oilcan.io). I'm proud of my work at all of these places. I've made friends, and, more than anything, I've learned a lot.

<em>One Mo' Gin</em> is a southern colloquial conflation of the terms "One More Time" and "Again". I used to think there was some emotional and or psychological reason why I loved this phrase so much, but nowadays, I mostly just like the sound of it.
